### Hello there! My name is Jack Boesen and I am from a Northwest suburb of Chicago called Roselle, IL. Here at the University of Iowa, I am an energetic and efficient double major in Data Analytics and Marketing with a minor in Psychology and Sport & Recreation Management, graduating in May of 2025. With this, I am currently seeking an internship or full-time position in which I can leverage my skills in technology and studies in business research and marketing to contribute to the success of an organization while gaining valuable professional experience. I am dependable, conscientious, and frequently praised as a hard worker by employers and colleagues alike. Through modeling, chart analysis, and valuation skills, I am ready to cooperate with others and grow as a whole. Employment where I can engage in a role that I can help better the companyâ€™s performance while learning new skills and expressing current ones is the opportunity I desire.
